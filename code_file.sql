/* So, RSVP Movies plans to make a movie on one of these genres.
Now, don't you want to know in which genre were the highest number of movies produced?
Combining both the 'movie' and the 'genre' table can give us interesting insights. */

-- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- Q6.Which genre had the highest number of movies produced overall?

-- Hint: Utilize the COUNT() function to count the occurrences of movie IDs for each genre.
-- Hint: Group the results by the 'genre' column using the GROUP BY clause.
-- Hint: Order the results by the count of movie IDs in descending order using the ORDER BY clause.
-- Hint: Use the LIMIT clause to restrict the result to only the top genre with the highest movie count.

-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- Q8.What is the average duration of movies in each genre? 
-- (Note: The same movie can belong to multiple genres.)

-- Hint: Utilize a LEFT JOIN to combine the 'genre' and 'movie' tables based on the 'movie_id'.
-- Hint: Specify table aliases for clarity, such as 'g' for 'genre' and 'm' for 'movie'.
-- Hint: Employ the AVG() function to calculate the average duration for each genre.
-- Hint: GROUP BY the 'genre' column to calculate averages for each genre.


/* Output format:

+---------------+-------------------+

select * from movie;
select * from genre;

/* Note that using an outer join is important as we are dealing with a large number of null values. Using
   an inner join will slow down query processing. */

/* Now you know that movies of genre 'Drama' (produced highest in number in 2019) have an average duration of
106.77 mins.
Let's find where the movies of genre 'thriller' lie on the basis of number of movies.*/

-- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    
-- Q9.What is the rank of the ‘thriller’ genre of movies among all the genres in terms of number of movies produced?
